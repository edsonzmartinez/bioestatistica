# A study was conducted on the effects of ploidy on the prognosis of
# patients with cancers of the mouth. Patients were selected who had
# a paraffin-embedded sample of the cancerous tissue taken at the time
# of surgery. Follow-up survival data was obtained on each patient. The
# tissue samples were examined using a flow cytometer to determine
# if the tumor had an aneuploid (abnormal) or diploid (normal) DNA
# profile using a technique discussed in Sickle-Santanello et al. (1988).
